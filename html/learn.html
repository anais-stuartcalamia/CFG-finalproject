    <h2 id="h2multi"> The Multi Disciplinary Approach &#127757</h2>
        <p>Looking at restoring and healing a planet, in which it's ressources have been taken fro granted over centuries of overexploitation, is easier done than said. We cannot only rely on scientist or climate engineers to fixe the issues that are arising. If we are to take a step in the right direction we have to work on all fronts using a multi-disciplinary approach. </p>
        <blockquote><i>While climate scientists focus on measuring greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of climate change on the health and ability of ecosystems to regulate those emissions, biodiversity experts focus on the effect climate change is having on biodiversity and the growing extinction of species. Social scientists see climate change as contributing to social and political stress, which may increase conflict and crime rates, while legislators and policy makers view climate change in a broader context of political and development interests. The view is different for those in the criminal justice system who, if they consider climate change, often do not have the tools to differentiate the impacts that crimes have on ecosystem resiliency, biodiversity loss or on greenhouse gas emissions. <a href="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/files/Publication/file/8mie6esklg_Crimes_that_Affect_the_Environment_and_Climate_Change.pdf?_ga=2.208621202.1842893561.1673353690-1429001621.1673353690" target="_blank">WWF</a></i></blockquote>
        <p>There are many theories about how nature is a cultural concept, one that has been socially constructed throughout centuries. This conception of a social construction of nature is in majority present in Western countries, creating a dichotomy between nature and society (Ingold, 2000; Cronon, 1995; Robbinson et al, 2010). A separation between the human world and the non-human one. These constructivist theories argue that the portrayal of nature as the sublime, including images of untouched landscapes and wilderness, is a product of media, culture and education (Robbinson et al, 2010). </p>
        <p>This approach usually bring up more questions than answers as most politics but also individuals are not ready to face some of the consequences that will arise with such debates. One of them is taking into consideration:  climate change cannot be resolved until Western Countries appologise for past colonial wars and destructions made. For this to happen, it would mean that Western countries would have to pay a taxe or some kind of financial incentive towards countries that canniot afford toput in place green economies.
