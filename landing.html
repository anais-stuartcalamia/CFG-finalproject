     <p>This website has been created as a ressource for you to learn more about fighting against climate change, understand your impact and our impact as a whole on the planet, what we can do about it. It is only through taking responsibility for our actions and day to day decisions that we can all create a positve impact on our planet. <br> We have to look at things not just through a science lens but a hollistic one, the aspects that are impacting millions of lives at this moment whith the rise of oceans and the need for communities to be re-homed for example. FOr or our children's sake, what kind of future do we want them to live in . The decisiosns that we make in the present are the ones that we will be remmbered by in the future.
       <br> Through interactive quizzes, or the ressource page you will hopefully get a better grasp and deeper understanding of the challenges we face today.
       <br> ClimateCode is a project website done through the 8 week Intro to Web Dev course by Code First Girls.

        <h3>Our Lands</h3>
        <p>Our lands, meaning the forests, fields, beaches, anything that is not water are taking on a lot of our bad decisions when it comes to waste pollution, deforestation, and so forth.
            Laws are passed, policies are put in place to make sure that we can reduce our impact what else can we do? Should we just be relying on politics to fight this unfortunate battle. A hollistic approach would be to look at all this from a different perspective
            and instead of looking at as a fight, we should look at it as a need to re-connect with the land, Nature. There have been arguments about how we have been losing our sense of self and connection with our bodies,to busy being part of the hustling culture that we have forgottent to stop and breath.
            What would happen if we finally stoped, breath and rebuild a sense of purpose and connection with the land, maybe we would be treating the way we are.

    <h3>Our Oceans</h3>   
    <p> <h3>Our Oceans</h3>  What is happening to our Oceans? When looking at safeguarding our Oceans scientists and climate change activist agree that soemthinghas to be done. What is often overlooked when talking about Ocean recovery is the geopolitical atmosphere of the world. We find ourselves in a globalised wordl and politics, economics, reliogions and cultures influence decisions. Here is a quote from WWF: </p>
    <blockquote><i>The nexus of oceans, geopolitical tensions, conflict, crime, and societal instability is on the rise. A robust ocean conservation agenda must therefore include natural resource conflict resolution, peacebuilding, and law enforcement capacity building.</i></blockquote>
    <p>There has been a rise of concern in recent years about the health of the ocean and seas, countries realising that their economy and heritage could be damaged if nothing is done to protect the ocean. Especially human activities that are not regulated could affect not just one country surrounding the body of water but the others that surround it too. The result of human activities taking place in the sea have distorted the marine biodiversity and caused unalterable harm to the marine ecosystems (a: Papageorgiou, 2016). Thus, occasionally scarce marine resources that are susceptible to reach exhaustion levels with an ecosystem that could possibly stop delivering valuable services to us, and lead to a difficult future and decision making (a: Papageorgiou, 2016).<br>
        Therefore, it is important to safeguard the seas through the establishment of protocols and values that would regulate the development of human activities taking place in a marine environment. There is a rise in international and national bodies (such as the European Union) to acknowledge threats facing the marine ecosystems, leading them to turn towards more sustainable practices, tools and concepts (a: Papageorgiou, 2016). Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) is one of them, which is constantly being brought up and used by more and more international and national bodies (public and private) to implement policies and guidelines, pushing towards sustaining a healthy marine ecosystem and space (a: Papageorgiou, 2016).
